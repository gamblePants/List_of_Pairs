# List_of_Pairs

A simple exercise: Given a list of integers and an integer(k), write a program which splits the list in to pairs, and checks each pair to see if the difference equals k

## Purpose

For educational purposes (mainly my own). An exercise using lists, arrays and for-loops. This is an example of the type of question I have seen during a programming interview test. There are different ways of solving this question, in this case it is solved with 2 for-loops.

## How to run program

<ul>
  <li>The easiest way is to run the program online from DonNetFiddle: https://dotnetfiddle.net/O16f2C</li>
  <li>Alternatively click on the "Release" tab, download the "Source code" zipped folder and extract</li>
  <li>The List_of_Pairs.csproj file will need to be run in an IDE that can compile in C# (like Visual Studio)</li>
</ul>
